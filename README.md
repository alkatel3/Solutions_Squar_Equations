# Solutions_Squar_Equations

This program implements the ability to solve a quadratic equation in two modes in the first mode the user enters the coefficients manually from the console and in the second mode the user provides the path to a file containing the coefficients located on a particular template. In the Main method, there is an example of a polymorphism, namely the call of the ReadData and SolutionEquations methods, which are defined in the base class Mode and redefined in the derived classes OnLineMode and OffLineMode.
